# Lantern Chrome Extension

![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/getlantern/lantern-chrome-extension/master/screenshot.png)

Google Chrome extension for Lantern Get Mode users.

This is currently at hello world status. It should eventually show Lantern
activity on the current page (which requests were proxied by which peers),
with a badge showing the total number of proxied requests for the current page,
and allow adding or removing the current site to the proxied sites list.
